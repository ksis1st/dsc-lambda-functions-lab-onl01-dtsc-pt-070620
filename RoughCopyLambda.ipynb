The last time I went there I had the Pork Pad se Ew and it tasted good, but I finished my plate and was still hungry. I used to know the manager here and she would greet me with a \"Hello Melissa, nice to see you again, diet coke & pad thai or pad se ew?\" Now a days, I know she still knows me but she disregards my presence. Also, I had asked her what was up with the new portion sizes and she had no answer for me. Great food but not worth the money. I havent been back in over a year because I refuse to pay $10-15 for dinner and still be hungry after. Sorry PinKaow, you are not what you used to be!!'"

    "Great! Hopefully, you're getting the hang of lambda functions now! It's important not to overuse them - it will often make more sense to define a function so that it's reusable elsewhere. But whenever you need to quickly apply some simple processing to a collection of data you have a new technique that will help you to do just that. It'll also be useful if you're reading someone else's code that happens to use lambdas."
